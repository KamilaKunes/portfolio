                                <p> 
                                
                                My heart is set on pursuing the intersection between electrical engineering and the human nervous system with an emphasis on disease and disorder treatment. This includes research such as devise design that would aid in the regain of motor control of patients with ALS or spinal injuries by interpreting voltage signals from the brain and relaying the signals directly to the muscles, or lessening the effects of rheumatoid arthritis by stimulating the vagus nerve via an implanted device. I believe this device-oriented approach to medicine has multiple under-researched frontiers with ample untapped potential.<br/><br/>
                                
                                In high school, I followed the medical track; I was a lab manager of the BioScience Academy. This led to job shadows at facilities such as Amgen, mammalian cell labs, hospital labs, and emergency rooms. I strongly considered pursuing a career as a neurosurgeon due to my love of medicine and the brain. However, I could not ignore my love for math, physics, and modern technology. I decided that the latter of my stated interests took precedence over my fascination with the medical industry.<br/><br/>
                                    
                                I had decided upon my arrival at UCLA to take neuroscience classes on the side in addition to my major Electrical Engineering courses, and to keep up to date on articles concerning modern medicine in my free time. As I formed connections with the Electrical Engineering faculty, I realized there was an overlap between technology and medicine that I hadn’t previously considered. The professor I had worked under for a few months, Dr. Achuta Kadambi, had been working on medical device equity to ensure devices had the same performance across demographics. I met with him a few times in my own volition to talk about my interests, including neuroscience and engineering ethics. He was able to point me to other faculty members who’s research overlapped with my own passions. This is how I met Jonathan Kao, a professor who conducted his PhD research in developing a sort of “brain chip” that would interpret brain signals from primates. Speaking with him excited me. I felt that I had found something that encompassed every aspect of my quirky passions.<br/><br/>
                                    
                                After this interaction, I began searching for labs at UCLA where I could learn more about the brain while still exercising my engineering abilities. I sent numerous emails to different research labs, and a few had emailed back. This is how I found the Arac Lab. This neurology lab seemed to fit just right with what I was looking for. They were in need of someone with engineering knowledge to set up the hardware and software for a new behavior experiment. I quickly accepted the offer and have been working there since.<br/><br/>
                                    
                                Entering this lab opened my eyes to the possibility of pursuing a PhD in a neuro-technical field. Although not completely set in stone, obtaining my PhD is my current goal as a next step into my professional career. What follows this milestone is variable.<br/><br/>
                                    
                                I aspire to apply my education and career in a way such that I can be a resource for those who need it. Above all, I value people; second to this I value intelligence and innovation. To me, a life well spent includes finding a way to uphold these values to create a societal impact.<br/><br/>
